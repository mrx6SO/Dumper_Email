@ Stant copy

Back up all the files that you want to a pen drive, email (just @gmail for now), or some path in your pc.

JUST RUN:

chmod 775 main.py
python main.py

with your defined settings,

and then the copy is initialized.

Just pay attention in what path or pen drive are you gonna copy the files.

In comments on the code i'd explaining about that.

More functions soon.

Peace,
