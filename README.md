Back up all the files that you want to a pen drive, email (just @gmail for now), or some path in your pc.

with your defined settings,

Just run:

# chmod 775 main.py
# python main.py

and then the copy is initialized.

# Just pay attention in what path or pen drive are you gonna copy the files.

In comments in the codes this is  explainned.
